# Flutter Bluetooth App 

A basic app that scans for bluetooth devices. Connects to HC-06 or HC-05 module and shows data upcoming on screen with a line plot. 

## What Could be added:

-> Saving data and retrieve them from sql database 

-> Sharing data

-> Implementing a better Graphic library since fl_chart doesn't provide scrollable flex plotting widgets.
